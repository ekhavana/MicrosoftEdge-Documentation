# Microsoft Edge Developer Guide
This guide provides an overview of the developer features and standards included in Microsoft Edge.

## What's new in EdgeHTML 15
Here are the changes shipped with the current release of the Microsoft Edge platform,
 as of the [Windows Creators Update(MM/YYYY)](). For changes in Windows Insider Preview builds, see
 the Microsoft Edge [Changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/changelog/).

### New features

#### CSS Custom Properties

#### Intersection Observer

#### Payment Request API

#### Service Worker

#### WebRTC

#### WebVR

### Updated features

#### Content Security Policy (Level 2)
Sites already using CSP 1 should continue to work with Microsoft Edge support for CSP 2, however it's best to switch any `frame-src` directives that load worker scripts to the new `child-src` directive to future-proof your site. (In CSP 3, `frame-src` will no longer apply to workers.) CSP 2 also adds the following:

1. New directives: `base-uri`, `child-src`, `form-action`, `frame-ancestors` and `plugin-types`. See [Edge supported CSP directives](./security/content-Security-Policy) for more.

2. Workers support: Background worker scripts are governed by their own policy, separate from the policy of the document loading them. As with host documents, you can set the CSP for a worker in the response header. Also new in CSP 2 is that  `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` flags of the `sandbox` directive now affect worker thread creation.

3. Inline scripts and styles: CSP 2 allows for the execution of inline scripts and style blocks by providing nonces and hashes as a whitelisting mechanism. Nonces are random base-64 values generated on each page load that appears in both the CSP policy and in the script tags in the page. When the page is dynamically generated on load, the server generates a nonce value, inserts it into the NonceToken in the page and also declares it in the Content Security Policy HTTP header. Hashes are static values generated (via *sha256*, *sha384* or *sha512* algorithms) from the content of a `<script>` or `<style>` element that are then specified (via `script-src` or `style-src` directives) in the CSP policy.

4. CSP violation reporting: A new event, SecurityPolicyViolationEvent is now fired upon CSP violations. The earlier mechanism for CSP reporting, `report-uri`, continues to be supported. Several new fields have been added to the violation reports common to both, including `effectiveDirective` (the policy that was violated), `statusCode` (the HTTP response code), `sourceFile` (the URL of the offending resource), `lineNumber`, and `columnNumber`.

#### Fetch

#### Web Authentication

#### WebDriver
